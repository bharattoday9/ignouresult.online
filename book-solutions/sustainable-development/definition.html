                                        <p><em>Sustainable development is an approach to economic planning that attempts to foster economic growth while preserving the natural environment for future generations. It is a holistic approach that recognizes the interdependence between the environment, economy, and society. It is an effort to develop a society in which resources are used efficiently, the environment is protected, and economic and social equity is achieved.</em></p>
<p>At its core, sustainable development is about meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It is an effort to balance the interests of individuals, society, and the environment in order to achieve a better quality of life for all.</p>
<h2>Key Aspects of Sustainable Development</h2>
<p>The following are some key aspects of sustainable development:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ensuring a balance between economic growth and environmental protection</strong>: Sustainable development seeks to ensure economic growth while protecting the environment. This includes using renewable energy sources, implementing pollution control measures, and conserving natural resources.</li>
<li>
<strong>Promoting social equity</strong>: Sustainable development promotes social equity by ensuring that all members of society have access to basic needs such as food, shelter, and health care.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reducing poverty</strong>: Sustainable development seeks to reduce poverty by creating economic opportunities and ensuring access to resources.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improving public health</strong>: Sustainable development promotes public health by providing safe water, sanitation, and health care services.</li>
<li>
<strong>Protecting biodiversity:</strong> Sustainable development seeks to protect biodiversity by conserving natural habitats and species.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improving education</strong>: Sustainable development seeks to improve education by providing access to quality education and training opportunities.</li>
<li>
<strong>Promoting sustainable consumption</strong>: Sustainable development seeks to promote sustainable consumption by encouraging people to reduce their consumption of resources.</li>
<li>
<strong>Promoting good governance</strong>: Sustainable development seeks to promote good governance by implementing policies that are transparent, accountable, and equitable.</li>
<li>
<strong>Strengthening communities</strong>: Sustainable development seeks to strengthen communities by supporting the development of local economies and creating jobs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Protecting human rights</strong>: Sustainable development seeks to protect human rights by ensuring all people have access to basic needs, such as food, shelter, and health care.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sustainable development is a complex process that requires a holistic approach that takes into account the interdependence between the environment, economy, and society. It is an approach to economic planning that seeks to foster economic growth while preserving the natural environment for future generations.</p>
<h2>Details from the IGNOU Self Learning Material (BPAG-174 Chapter 1)</h2>
<p>Key pointers that should be kept in mind while answering this question:</p>
<ol>
<li>The &quot;Our Common Future&quot; Report is credited with giving rise to the term &quot;<strong>sustainable development</strong>.&quot;</li>
<li>It refers to progress that satisfies current demands without compromising future needs.</li>
<li>Sustainable development is much more than just environmental preservation.</li>
<li>Both qualitative and quantitative changes to the economy are considered.</li>
<li>Environmental analysis and environmental deterioration are its main topics.</li>
<li>It deals with issues of justice, equity, and peace.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Meaning of the term 'Sustainable Development'</h2>
<p>The phrase &quot;sustainable development&quot; was first used in the early 1970s by Barbara Ward (also known as Lady Jackson), the founder of the International Institute for Environment and Development, much earlier than the Brundtland Report's concept.</p>
<p>In a setting where environment-society imbalances could jeopardise economic and social stability, she saw sustainable development as primarily focusing on people, their economic and social well-being, and hopes for equity in their connections with one another. However, it is the Brundtland Report, also known as the World Commission on Environment and Development's Our Common Future report, which defines sustainable development as development that &quot;meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&quot; This means that it aims to appease the demands of equity both within and between human generations.</p>
<p>Therefore, &quot;sustainable development&quot; is growth that satisfies the demands of both the present and the future. It is hardly surprising that sustainable development has become a buzzword in development planning and resource management given the local as well as global implications of environmental decline. Interpretations of this idea are still unclear, though.</p>
<p>According to the Brundtland Report, the concept of sustainable development goes far beyond environmental protection because it refers to a transformational process in which resource exploitation, investment choices, the focus of technological advancement, and institutional adjustments are made in line with both present and future needs. It is a balanced and adaptive process of change rather than a static state of harmony.</p>
<p>Sustainability assumes &quot;the balance between economic development—all quantitative and qualitative adjustments to the economy that offer positive contributions to welfare—and ecological sustainability—all quantitative and qualitative environmental measures that serve to improve the quality of an ecosystem and thereby also have a positive impact on welfare.&quot; A specific minimal threshold value is required for the survival of both economic and environmental systems.</p>
<p>The old belief that environmental conservation is a luxury while economic progress is a need is rejected by the idea of sustainable development. &quot;Environmental resources are of modest importance to poor countries,&quot; note Dasgupta and Maler (1990). They have a big impact on the process of economic growth. Such resources are luxury items, and the general public only pays attention to them when incomes are high. Only wealthy nations are concerned about the environment. They are only economic diversions that do not take into account the actual needs of the underprivileged in developing nations.</p>
<p>However, in the last ten years, there has been a shift from a partial environmental analysis to a focus on the global effects of environmental decay, which are among other things reflected in alarming phenomena like flooding, acid rains, soil erosion, desertification, ozone layer destruction, ocean pollution, and resource extraction. Thus, formerly considered as frills, resource conservation and pollution management are now recognised as necessities to safeguard life-sustaining natural systems and raise living standards. The necessity for socioeconomic growth to be sustainable—that is, able to meet not only the requirements of this generation but also those of future generations—is being recognised by policymakers more and more.</p>
<p>How to evaluate the welfare of the present and future generations is at issue in this situation. What should we leave behind for future generations to increase the likelihood that they won't fare worse than we did? The problem is made more difficult by the fact that in addition to inheriting our worn-out farmlands, eroded hillsides, polluted water, parched grasslands, and depleted ozone layer, our children also get to enjoy the benefits of our labour in the form of physical capital as well as education, skills, and knowledge. They have a right to gain from initiatives to conserve natural resources, increase soil fertility, and reforest areas.</p>
<p>According to Ashish Kothari (1993), sustainable development &quot;does not effectively address the maintenance of intergenerational, inter-species injustice&quot; and is thus &quot;inacceptable from the point of view of the wider human goals of happiness, equality, justice, and peace.&quot;</p>

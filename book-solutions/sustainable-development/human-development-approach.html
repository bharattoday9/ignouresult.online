                                <div class="content my-4">
                                        <p>I am a proponent of the Human Development approach to sustainable livelihoods that is based on the idea that human beings should be the primary focus of economic and social development, and that an equitable and just society is essential for a sustainable future. It emphasizes the role of human capital, education, access to healthcare, and the rights of individuals to make decisions about their own lives.</p>
<p>From my perspective, sustainable livelihoods are based on the notion that people should have access to the resources and opportunities needed to live healthy, productive, and dignified lives. This means that a person has access to resources that enable them to provide for their basic needs, such as food, shelter, healthcare, and education. In order to achieve this, individuals must have access to employment, income, and asset ownership.</p>
<p>The Human Development approach also highlights the importance of individual autonomy and the right of individuals to make decisions about their own lives such as the right to choose one’s own livelihood, to set goals, and to take risks in order to pursue one’s ambitions, the right to access resources and opportunities, such as credit and microfinance, that can help individuals build assets and increase their income.</p>
<p>I believe that this approach is essential for creating sustainable livelihoods. It puts people at the center of development and focuses on their potential to create a better future. By providing individuals with the tools and resources they need to create a more secure and equitable future, we can ensure that sustainable livelihoods are a reality for everyone.</p>
<h2>Explaining the Human Development Approach to Sustainable Livelihoods</h2>
<p>The well-being of people is referred to as human development, and achieving this objective is crucial for every society or government. According to a World Gallup Survey that includes 98% of the population, human well-being is known as Subjective Well-Being (SWB) because people around the world have their own perceptions of happiness and well-being.</p>
<p>The United Nations Sustainable Solutions Network produces the World Happiness Report. Human development is both a process and a result, with an emphasis on the outcomes of more options. The simplest way to describe it is as a process of expanding possibilities. Every day, people make a variety of decisions in the areas of economics, society, politics, and culture.</p>
<p>The extension of choices for every human is the ultimate purpose of human evolution, not the accumulation of more riches or the acceleration of economic growth (Human Development Report, 2001). The social, urban, and environmental components of the environment are given particular attention in the eighth annual World Happiness Report (WHR), which is also known as WHR 2020.</p>
<p>The WHR's  (World Happiness Report) objective is to examine the field of SWB measurement and understanding while using survey data on life satisfaction to monitor the standard of living across more than 150 nations. Their primary objective is to assess how happy people are in various social contexts.</p>
<h3>Primary Areas of Focus in Human Development Approach</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Social Environment for Happiness</strong>: World Happiness Report measures several facets of the social environment and explains happiness using six elements such as the following:
<ul>
<li>Having someone to rely on;</li>
<li>Feeling free to make important life decisions;</li>
<li>Generosity;</li>
<li>Trust;</li>
<li>How inequality affects happiness on a global scale; and</li>
<li>How a healthy social environment works to combat inequality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Urban Happiness</strong>: Cities in the same nation have been compared in terms of how happy their residents are with city living. City dwellers were found to be happy than those who lived outside of cities, while the urban happiness advantage might occasionally be negative, according to the WHR, which discovered that city rankings and country rankings were nearly comparable.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sustainable Natural Environment</strong>: People wish to conserve their natural environment as they become more cognizant of and aware of it. According to the WHR's report, several contaminants have a negative impact on life assessments. Forests do not have any favourable influence on emotions, despite having positive effects on life appraisal. According to their London-based survey, which looked at the relationship between people's happiness and the natural world, people reported feeling happier more often when they were near a river, canal, or public park, or when they were engaging in activities like birdwatching, walking in parks, etc., as opposed to staying sedentary at home.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sustainable Development and Human Well Being</strong>: Information on the inter-connection between SD and wellbeing is available from the WHR. The SWB is a measure of wellbeing, as was previously mentioned, and survey results may differ from emotional well-being measurements compared to economic well-being indicators like income and development. Other metrics, such as the Human Development Index, Index of Economic Freedoms, Global Peace Index, Global Competitiveness Index, Environmental Protection Index (EPI), and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, were included to the evaluation of SDGs in connection to wellbeing. By examining three indices, the Human Development Index (HDI) gauges the degree of welfare inside a nation.
<ol>
<li>Those that use &quot;life expectancy indicators&quot; talk about the life expectancy at birth;</li>
<li>Adult literacy rate and gross enrolment ratio are examples of educational attainment indicators.</li>
<li>Measurement of standard of living using GDP per person</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Human Development Approach is significant for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and benefiting people and the planet. A survey found that this approach is as important as the Environmental Performance Index and Gross Domestic Product per capita in terms of progress on SDGs. The approach helps to prioritize which SDGs to focus on, given limited budgets, while recognizing that all SDGs are important.</p>
<p>To put it simply, the Human Development Approach is a way of thinking about development that focuses on improving the well-being and self-sufficiency of individuals and communities. This approach has been found to be important for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are a set of global targets for addressing social, economic, and environmental challenges. A survey showed that the Human Development Approach is as significant as other measures, such as the Environmental Performance Index and Gross Domestic Product per capita, in terms of progress on the SDGs. Additionally, the approach can help to prioritize which SDGs to focus on given limited budgets, while recognizing that all of the SDGs are important.</p>

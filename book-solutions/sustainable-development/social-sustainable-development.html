                                        <p><em>Social sustainable development is an evolving concept that is becoming increasingly important to the way in which societies operate. It is a combination of economic and environmental sustainability, with a focus on social justice. In order to understand social sustainable development, it is important to understand the different dimensions that comprise it.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Equity</strong>: Equity is a central concept in social sustainable development. It refers to the fair and equitable distribution of resources and opportunities among all members of society. Equity ensures that everyone has the same rights and access to resources regardless of race, gender, class, or other social characteristics.</li>
<li>
<strong>Inclusion</strong>: Inclusion is a key dimension of social sustainable development. It involves making sure that all members of society are included in decision-making processes and have access to resources. It seeks to ensure that all members of society, regardless of their background or identity, are able to participate in the development of their community.</li>
<li>
<strong>Participation</strong>: Participation is an important factor in social sustainable development. It involves encouraging people to take part in decision-making and to actively engage in the development of their community. Participation can take many forms, including direct democracy, deliberative democracy, and citizen engagement.</li>
<li>
<strong>Empowerment</strong>: Empowerment is a key part of social sustainable development. It involves supporting individuals and communities to take control of their own development. It also involves creating opportunities for individuals and communities to be heard and have a say in decisions that affect them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Resilience</strong>: Resilience is an important concept in social sustainable development. It involves building the capacity of individuals and communities to respond to and adapt to changing circumstances. It also involves developing strategies to cope with shocks and stresses and to create more sustainable livelihoods and communities.</li>
<li>
<strong>Connectivity</strong>: Connectivity is a key dimension of social sustainable development. It involves creating networks of individuals, organizations, and communities that can work together to shape their own development. Connectivity can help create more equitable and inclusive societies by connecting different groups to each other and to resources.</li>
<li>
<strong>Well-Being</strong>: Well-being is an important factor in social sustainable development. It involves creating communities where people are able to live healthy, fulfilling, and meaningful lives. This involves not only providing access to resources and opportunities, but also creating supportive environments where people can thrive.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sustainability</strong>: Sustainability is a core concept in social sustainable development. It involves creating systems and strategies that are designed to last into the future. This involves developing strategies that are environmentally sustainable, economically viable, and socially just.</li>
<li>
<strong>Innovation</strong>: Innovation is an important part of social sustainable development. It involves developing new ideas, technologies, and approaches that can be used to create more sustainable and equitable societies. Innovation can help create new opportunities and reduce inequality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, social sustainable development is a complex concept that involves many different dimensions. It is an evolving concept that seeks to create more equitable and sustainable societies. Understanding the different dimensions of social sustainable development can help inform how societies can work to create more just and equitable societies.</p>
<h2>Details from IGNOU Self Learning Material</h2>
<p>To attain sustainability, social components must integrate both human and social elements. It seeks to create socio-cultural stability and stop the social ills of estrangement in our day and age. Due to a lack of job satisfaction and an incorrect view of the nature of their profession, the general public feels frustrated. Since we live in a relativism-era world, there are no absolutes, and diseases make the future more unpredictable.</p>
<p>Viruses including Ebola, Zika, SARS, MERS, swine flu, and now COVID-19 have all been seen around the world. Social justice, health equality, community development, human rights, social responsibility, and labour rights are only a few examples of the concerns that make up social sustainability. All aspects of the economy and environment are in some ways social since they have an impact on society. Societies that are socially sustainable strive to provide a high quality of life by being democratic, diverse, equitable, and linked.</p>
<h3>What are the Dimensions of Social Sustainable Development?</h3>
<p>The world has advanced significantly since the three pillars of sustainable development were established. In 2015, the United Nations created 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), encompassing the majority of the pertinent topics, with the cooperation of 193 member countries. A programme on social dimensions of sustainable development was created by the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD), with a focus on understanding, analysing, and participating in processes of policy change that could address unsustainable practises, climate change, and inequalities. In support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it requires attention to the intersectionality of social, environmental, and economic challenges at many levels.</p>
<h4>Four Dimensions according to Amartya Sen</h4>
<p>Numerous elements influence a society's quality of life, but it is crucial to make ongoing efforts to improve it in order to further human growth. Financial conservatism, or the desire to give financing for social benefits, is a problem when doing this. Instead of increasing expenditure on health or literacy, the majority of government budgets support military expenses.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>QUALITY OF LIFE</strong>: It has a variety of components, including access to safe and secure housing, medical care for the body and mind, educational and training options, employment opportunities, and opportunities for employment. The wellbeing of people in a society is strongly related to quality of life. Development is equated with freedom because having access to even the most fundamental comforts of life makes one free—whether that freedom be from illiteracy, poverty, or any other ailment. Development is an integrated process that increases important interconnected social, political, and economic freedoms. The following list includes some quality of life factors that must be taken into account:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Personal Differences</strong>: Each person has special needs that are specific to them because of features including age, gender, disease, and handicap. Some issues might not receive the equitable treatment that is needed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Environmental Diversity</strong>: People have different demands depending on the types of environmental conditions they are exposed to, such as cold, hot, or rainy weather. People's quality of life can be affected by pollution or unfavourable environmental conditions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Societal Climate</strong>: Crime, violence, educational resources, interpersonal connections, and public amenities all have an impact on social capital, which in turn affects quality of life.</li>
<li>
<strong>Relational Aspect</strong>: Community ties, which are founded on culture, customs, and norms, have an impact on quality of life. Some signs that reveal how a person lives in a community include their appearance, behaviour, and level of self-respect.</li>
<li>
<strong>Income Distribution</strong>: A family's income distribution has an impact on the freedom or general well-being of its members.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Equality and Diversity</strong>: International organizations like the United Nations have used indicators to measure the sustainability of each country's development, but this has also led to an increase in inequality between the wealthy and the poor. The number of disadvantaged &amp; poor people has risen globally. Agenda 21 calls for developed countries to give 0.15% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to developing &amp; underdeveloped countries, but the most they have actually given is 0.7% of their GDP. It is believed that increasing this aid could significantly reduce global poverty. The concept of equality leads to the social dimension of diversity, as disadvantaged groups in society are often part of diverse populations. Nations should work to address the imbalance among these groups and help the vulnerable. For instance, India has a quota system that provides education and employment opportunities to disadvantaged groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Cohesion</strong>: Social cohesion means that a society works towards the well-being of its people. This can be achieved by making it easy for people to access public institutions and benefit from them, so that they can also contribute to society. For example, if people register with a government employment exchange, they can take advantage of job opportunities. Issues to focus on for a good social cohesion: <em>&quot;The degree to which a group participates in social activities, their comprehension of and access to public and civic institutions, and their contribution to society all have a role in their sense of belonging to the larger community.&quot;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Democracy and Governance</strong>: In a country with democratic governance, social sustainability can be more successfully attained. The budget and resources needed for the government's programmes are easily available in a democratic society.</p>
</li>

<p>Although Amartya Sen was unequivocal about people having needs, it is equally true that they have values. It is incorrect to assume that the generations specified in the definition of SD share the same tastes or inclinations. However, there is no separating social issues from economic or environmental worries. With accords between nations for trade like the General Agreement on Trade and Services and the Trade in Intellectual Property Rights, the modern world has evolved into one of possessive individualism. While international organisations work for development, communities are breaking apart in the name of trade liberalisation, which results in a loss of capability and capacity. Concepts of communal rights over common resources like vegetation and water distribution have emerged in response to this concern.</p>

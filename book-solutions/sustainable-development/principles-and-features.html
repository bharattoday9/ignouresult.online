                                        <p><strong>The main principles and features of Sustainable development includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sustainable development is an approach to economic development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</li>
<li>It is an integrated approach to economic, social and environmental aspects of development, which takes into account the inter-relatedness of the three aspects and their effects on the long-term viability of economic development.</li>
<li>The concept of sustainable development was first introduced in 1987 by the Brundtland Commission, which defined it as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”.</li>
<li>As such, sustainable development focuses on the preservation of natural resources and the environment, while also promoting economic growth and social progress.</li>
<li>The principles of sustainable development are based on the idea that economic growth and social progress should not come at the expense of the environment.</li>
<li>Sustainable development encourages the use of renewable resources, efficient resource management and the provision of social services that contribute to the development of a healthy and vibrant society.</li>
<li>Sustainable development also involves the development of policies and strategies to reduce poverty and promote social equity.</li>
<li>Sustainable development also includes efforts to reduce or eliminate pollution and the destruction of ecosystems, as well as to promote conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources.</li>
<li>Sustainable development involves the promotion of economic growth that is supported by efficient resource management and the development of sustainable production and consumption patterns.</li>
<li>In order to achieve sustainable development, governments, businesses, and individuals must work together to reduce their environmental impact and promote social equity.</li>
<li>This requires the development of policies and strategies that are designed to promote the efficient use of resources, reduce pollution, and protect the environment.</li>
<li>It also requires the development of strategies to support economic growth and reduce poverty, while also promoting the development of a healthy and vibrant society.</li>
<li>Finally, it requires the development of strategies to promote the conservation of natural resources and the sustainable use of renewable resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Details from Self Learning Material (BPAG-174 Chapter 1: Section 1.5)</h2>
<p>The following content is basically a summary of Section 1.5 of BPAG-174 IGNOU Book CHAPTER 1.</p>
<h3>Principles of Sustainable Development</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Ecosystem Conservation</strong>: The preservation of the planet's resources is the primary goal of sustainable development. It serves to stabilise the natural system. For this reason and objective, ecosystem preservation, including aquatic ecosystem preservation, is essential.</li>
<li>
<strong>Societal Sustanaible Development</strong>: The demand for products and services rises as the population grows. The sustainability of society depends on having access to a suitable place to live, a healthy diet, adequate health care, a job, and high-quality education. For the benefit of society's citizens, access to health care and education is crucial.</li>
<li>
<strong>Biodiversity conservation</strong>: The protection of all the world's living species must be prioritised. The natural resources should be protected by teaching people how to conserve them. To stop the loss of biodiversity and restore ecosystem services before it is too late, the World Wildlife Fund's Living Planet Index (LPI) and the Global Biodiversity Outlook both call for extreme and quick action before September 2020.</li>
<li>
<strong>Population Control</strong>: The demand for products and services rises as the population grows, and if it stays the same, environmental damage will likely increase. The population of the globe is increasing at a rate of 1.7% yearly, or by roughly 100 million people. Poverty and environmental deterioration have a mutually reinforcing effect, which is made worse by the rapid population expansion. However, population growth can also be accelerated by environmental degradation. According to Dasgupta (Op. cit.), children are created both to increase the workforce and to earn money and ensure one's old age. Therefore, managing and controlling the population is crucial for sustainable development.</li>
<li>
<strong>Human Resources Conservation</strong>: Sustainable development has a lot of potential with human resources, or HR. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance human resources through offering training, healthcare, and education. The use of human resources greatly aids in sustainable development. Effective decision-making for environmental protection requires efficient human resources.</li>
<li>
<strong>Encouraging the Participation of Citizens</strong>: If residents actively participate in the implementation of sustainable development programmes, the process of sustainable development will take on a deeper significance. The Covid-19 Pandemic has brought to light how crucial environmental harmony is, particularly as we work to create communities and economies that are more resilient. The Covid-19 Pandemic has served as an ominous and agonising reminder of how important the idea of sustainable development is.</li>
<li>
<strong>International Coordiantion and Cooperation</strong>: For the sake of biological diversity, more deliberate international action is required. International environmental challenges must be resolved based on agreed-upon norms and guidelines for cooperation among independent nations, supported by persuasion and negotiation. There is a compelling argument for increased international efforts to provide finance and technology help to underdeveloped countries because of the widespread concern for biological resources on a global scale. The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) Nations should share best practises in order to achieve the sustainable development goals, according to the Union Environment Minister of India, who issued the call on July 31, 2020.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Features of Sustainable Development</h3>
<p>When making plans for economic development, certain aspects must be put into practise in order to achieve the goals and scope of sustainable development. Some of these steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases, which directly contribute to air pollution and global warming;</li>
<li>putting an emphasis on environmentally friendly activities, such as creating green buildings;</li>
<li>concentrating on and carrying out initiatives utilising renewable energy sources, such as the sun, wind, water, etc.;</li>
<li>preservation of natural resources while honouring and safeguarding living things' natural homes; and
preventing the pace of consumption from being higher than the level of renewable energy production.</li>
</ul>

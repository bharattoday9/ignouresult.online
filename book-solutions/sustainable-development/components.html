                                        <p>Sustainable development is a term used to describe the balance between the use of resources for the benefit of people and the conservation of natural resources for future generations. It is a concept that has been embraced by governments, businesses and citizens alike, as it seeks to promote economic and social progress while protecting the environment. The three components of sustainable development are economic, social and environmental.</p>
<h2>Economic Component of Sustainable Development</h2>
<ul>
<li>The economic component of sustainable development focuses on expanding economic opportunities while promoting economic growth that is more equitable, efficient and sustainable.</li>
<li>This component also seeks to reduce poverty and inequality, while providing fair wages and decent employment.</li>
<li>It encourages investment in renewable energy sources, green technologies and other initiatives that promote environmental protection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Social Component of Sustainable Development</h2>
<ul>
<li>The social component of sustainable development seeks to ensure access to basic services, such as education, health care, clean water and sanitation, for all citizens.</li>
<li>It also seeks to promote the rights of women, children and other vulnerable groups, in order to reduce inequalities and promote social justice.</li>
<li>Lastly, it promotes the protection of cultural heritage and the responsible use of natural resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Environmental Component of Sustainable Development</h2>
<ul>
<li>The environmental component of sustainable development focuses on the conservation of natural resources, such as forests and biodiversity, as well as the reduction of pollution.</li>
<li>It also seeks to reduce the overconsumption of natural resources, to prevent climate change and to promote sustainable agricultural practices.</li>
<li>Finally, it encourages the development of green technologies and renewable energy sources, as well as the protection of ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Importance of These Components</h2>
<p>By focusing on these three components of sustainable development, governments, businesses and citizens can ensure that resources are used responsibly, while protecting the environment and promoting economic and social progress. This will create a better future for current and future generations.</p>

<p>Below text is basically a summary of the Chapter 2 of IGNOU&#039;s SLM (Self Learning Material) of BPAG 174 (Sustainable Development) Course. It is a part of IGNOU&#039;s BAHIH (BA History Hons) course. It is also offered as a standalone course by IGNOU. This page offers chapter wise answers to all the questions asked in SLM (Self Learning Materials or Books) of IGNOU&#039;s Sustainable Development Course.</p>
<h3>Components of Sustainable Development: Explained</h3>
<p>When the Development Administration failed to adapt to the shifting economic and social environment, sustainable development became a reality. If Development Administration had not taken place, sustainable development would never have gotten to where it is now. Development Administration may be thought of as a facilitator of sustainable development. Hanns Carl VonCarlowitz coined the phrase &quot;sustainable use&quot; in his book &quot;nachhaltende Nutzung&quot; on sustainable forestry. As you know already by now that Sustainable development is a holistic approach to meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It involves balancing economic, social, and environmental considerations in order to achieve a better quality of life for all people, now and in the future.</p>
<p>The United Nations Environment Commission, led by Gro Harlem Brundlandt, the time&#039;s prime minister of Norway, later presented the idea of sustainable development in the Brundlandt Report. The environment was considered when the idea was being developed. According to one definition, sustainable development is &quot;development that satisfies present demands without compromising the capacity of future generations to satisfy their own needs.&quot;</p>
<p>The three main components of sustainable development are economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection. These components are often referred to as the &quot;three pillars&quot; of sustainable development.</p>
<p>Economic growth is essential for creating jobs, reducing poverty, and improving living standards. However, it must be pursued in a way that is sustainable and does not harm the environment or contribute to inequality. This means promoting economic activities that are diversified, resilient, and resource-efficient. It also means investing in sustainable infrastructure, technology, and human capital, as well as fostering entrepreneurship and innovation.</p>
<p>Social inclusion is about ensuring that all members of society have the opportunity to participate in and benefit from economic growth. This means promoting equality, inclusion, and non-discrimination, as well as addressing issues related to poverty, education, healthcare, and social protection. It also means protecting the rights of marginalized and vulnerable groups, such as women, children, and indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>Environmental protection is essential for ensuring the long-term sustainability of economic and social development. This means conserving natural resources, protecting ecosystems, and reducing pollution and waste. It also means adapting to and mitigating the impacts of climate change, as well as promoting the use of renewable and clean energy sources.</p>
<p>Other important elements of sustainable development include good governance, the fair distribution of resources, and the promotion of peace and security. Good governance is essential for ensuring that sustainable development is pursued in a transparent, accountable, and participatory manner. The fair distribution of resources is about ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared equitably among all members of society. And the promotion of peace and security is essential for creating the stable and secure conditions that are necessary for sustainable development.</p>
<h3>Two Important Concepts of Attached to Sustainable Development</h3>
<p>By now, everyone is aware that the Brundlandt Report, which has two key ideas that are integral to the process of sustainable management of the planet&#039;s resources, came to be known by its more well-known name:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>basic needs of humanity</strong> must be satisfied, including those for food, clothes, housing, and employment. First and foremost, this entails focusing on the world&#039;s poor, whose mainly unmet needs ought to be given first priority.</li>
<li>
<strong>Limits to Development</strong>: Although they are not absolute, the limits to development are imposed by the current levels of technology and social organisation, as well as by how they affect the environment&#039;s resources and the biosphere&#039;s capacity to withstand the effects of human activity. A new era of economic prosperity can be ushered in by managing and improving the technological and social structure.</li>
</ol>
<p>Governments, international organisations, and non-governmental organisations from all over the world were interested in the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The adoption of Agenda 21 at the Conference signifies a political commitment and global consensus at the highest level on socioeconomic progress and environmental cooperation. Economic, social, and environmental factors all contribute to sustainable development. By bridging the gap between development and the environment while taking these factors into consideration, anything is said to be sustainable.</p>
